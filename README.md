# 🚦 Traffic Light Checker — Python Project

This is a beginner-friendly Python script that asks the user to input a traffic light color (`Red`, `Yellow`, or `Green`) and displays the correct action according to standard traffic rules. It uses Python 3.10+'s `match-case` structure and provides a clean, decorated output.
